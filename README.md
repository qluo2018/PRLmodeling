computational modeling of the probabilistic reversal learning task

This package is related to the following manuscript 
"Common roles for serotonin in rats and humans for computations underlying flexible decision-making" 
by Q Luo, JW Kanen, A Bari, N Skadanli, C Langley, GM Knudsen, J Alsio, BU Phillips, BJ Sahakian, RN Cardinal, and TW Robbins,
that has been submitted to Neuropsychopharmocology 2023.

This package included the RStan code for the computaional modeling of probabilistic reversal learning task in four experiments. 

1) Serotonin depletion in rats;
2) Acute SSRI with low/high dose in rats;
3) Repeated and sub-chronic SSRI in rats;
4) Acute SSRI in humans.

The code was adpated by Dr. Qiang Luo from the codes written by Dr. Rudolf Cardinal in 2017 for the following paper
Kanen JW, Ersche KD, Fineberg NA, Robbins TW, Cardinal RN. 
Computational modelling reveals contrasting effects on reinforcement 
learning and cognitive flexibility in stimulant use disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder:
